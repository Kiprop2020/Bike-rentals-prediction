Hi, I'm still learning how to program and I am very new to GitHub

In this project, I attempted to to predict the total number of people who rent bikes in a given hour using Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forests Regressor.
The data that I will use was compiled by Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto and is available as a CSV file. 
The file contains 17380 rows, with each row representing the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day. 
The data can be dowloaded from the University of California, Irvine's website.

Any comments on how I can improve the project will be welcome. Thank you!
